Hitting Set Problem You are given a family of sets {S1, S2, . . . , Sn}. Find the smallest set H such that, for all i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}, H ∩ Si ̸= ∅. Assignment Implement a Prolog program that solves a given instance of the Hitting Set problem similar to the Knapsack problem or 8-Queens problem discussed in class. You program should have a predicate minHittingSet(Sets, Solution) where Sets is a given family of sets and Solution is a hitting set with minimum cardinality. For example, minHittingSet([[1], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3, 4], [4]], Solution). should output Solution = [1, 4] A set is represented as a sorted list of distinct integers. Sets is a list of such sets
